## Platform Introduction

EliteQuant is an open source forever free unified quant trading platform built by quant traders, for quant traders. It is dual listed on both [github](https://github.com/EliteQuant) and [gitee](https://gitee.com/EliteQuant).

The word unified carries two features.
- First it’s unified across backtesting and live trading. Just switch the data source to play with real money.
- Second it’s consistent across platforms written in their native langugages. It becomes easy to communicate with peer traders on strategies, ideas, and replicate performances, sparing language details.
